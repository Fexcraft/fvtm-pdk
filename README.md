# FVTM Pack Development Kit
Aim of this repository is to provide something which you can quickly download,    
run the gradle commands, and have a fvtm-addonpack ready to be created.

## Installation
Like a Forge MDK, download and run the gradle commands you would use when setting up a Forge Workspace.
